I used Matthew Cranford's walkthrough to write my code for this game. I can not link to the walk through because it was deleted a few days before I finished the game, but it was located here: "https://matthewcranford.com/arcade-game-walkthrough-part-5-adding-enemies/"

I used my own previous code to write the modal, located here: "https://github.com/vvordnerd/memory-game/blob/master/app.css"
